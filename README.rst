Things to do before adding to PyPI
----------------------------------

* Ensure documentation is available on readthedocs.org (and link to
  from the README, the short description on GitHub, and
  ``setup.py``);
* Check behaviour for creating email addresses where the generated
  mailbox name already exists, fix it, and add tests;
* Check behaviour for the cleanup needed if a mailbox is created, but
  email creation fails, and add tests.
